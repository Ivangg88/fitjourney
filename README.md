# FitJourney

## Problem Description

Many patients with obesity, especially those who have undergone bariatric surgery (gastric bypass) or have used medications for rapid weight loss, face the risk of losing muscle mass. This loss of muscle mass can lead to malnutrition in extreme cases. It is crucial to design a platform that provides comprehensive support, emotional support, education, and personalized monitoring to these patients to optimize their health and well-being. FitJourney is designed to be used by organizations and hospitals looking to provide personalized weekly exercise plans to their patients.

## Objetive

The main objective of FitJourney is to improve the quality of life for patients with obesity by providing them with effective tools to maintain and strengthen their muscle mass after interventions such as bariatric surgery. Organizations can use our platform to create and assign personalized weekly exercise plans to their patients and track their progress. In the future, we plan to partner with fitness companies to gamify these exercise plans, offering rewards to motivate patients to achieve their goals.

## Business Model

Our business model is based on working with organizations and hospitals aiming to improve the health and well-being of their patients. These organizations can use FitJourney to provide personalized exercise plans to their patients and track their progress. We seek to partner with fitness companies that can provide rewards to gamify the process and motivate patients to reach their goals.
